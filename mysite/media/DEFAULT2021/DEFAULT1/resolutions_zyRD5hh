	a)		allowing the deployment of military personnel to exclusive economic zones in order to defend the respected nation’s interest,

	b)		dedicating a portion of the Arctic region as a global common which can be used by any member state for exploration and research purposes,

	

3)		<u>Asks for</u> the enforcement of Arctic treaties, such as the (IAT) by the United Nations, achieved through ways such as but not limited to:

	a)		ensuring that all signatories abide by the articles through investigations conducted by the United Nations or another neutral party selected by the Arctic council, this will be achieved through ways such as but not limited to:

		i)		allowing the Arctic Council to maintain headquarters within the Arctic region and granting the organization with the right to investigate
